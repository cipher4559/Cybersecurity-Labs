# Malware & Suspicious Activity Detection using Wazuh

## Objective
To detect and analyze suspicious file activity on a Windows endpoint using Wazuh SIEM as part of SOC analyst operations.

## Environment
- Wazuh Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard on Kali Linux
- Windows Virtual Machine with Wazuh Agent
- VMware Workstation

## Lab Architecture
The Wazuh SIEM is deployed on Kali Linux. A Windows endpoint is integrated using a Wazuh Agent to forward security events and file activity logs to the SIEM for analysis.

## Activity Simulation
To simulate malware-like behavior, suspicious file operations were performed on the Windows system:
- File creation
- File modification
- File deletion

These actions represent common behaviors observed during malware execution or unauthorized access.

## Detection & Alerting
Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) detected the suspicious file activity and generated security alerts.

### Detection Details
- **Rule ID:** 510  
- **Category:** File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)  
- **Description:** File added, modified, or deleted  
- **Affected Path:** `C:\Users\Public\`  
- **Severity:** Medium  

The alert was triggered due to unexpected changes in monitored directories.

## Alert Analysis (SOC Perspective)
From a SOC analyst point of view:
- File integrity changes can indicate malware activity or unauthorized actions
- Repeated file creation and deletion requires further investigation
- Monitoring is recommended to detect patterns or escalation attempts

## SOC Actions
- Identified affected endpoint
- Analyzed file integrity alerts
- Verified no persistence remained after file removal
- Recommended continued monitoring

## Skills Gained
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Malware behavior analysis
- SIEM alert investigation
- SOC Level-1 incident handling
- Understanding of endpoint security telemetry

## Lab Outcome
Successfully detected suspicious file activity using Wazuh SIEM and performed alert analysis following SOC best practices.
